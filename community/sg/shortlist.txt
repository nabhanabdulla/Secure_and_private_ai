This group is aimed at working on Human Pose Estimation from 2D images. We will work on implementing this by reading literature about the work already done in this field. Even if we are not able to improve upon something, our baseline objective is to at least duplicate the results.

INTRO (AI Challenge Study Group)	
Join Here!
The purpose is that all the members get related with Pytorch and DL in a crecent manner. To this end, during the first two weeks the group will propose the implementation of some shallow networks and attainable deep ones (vote-based selection). Then, the members of the group decide a bigger project to work in for 1,5 months until the end of the Secure and Private Challenge (the pool of projects is proposed by all the members during the previous weeks, being selected the one with most votes). I have already talked in Slack with 4 students interested on the group (@Rakshit Naidu @Mallikarjuna @Mursal Furqan @Manisha). I initially suggested as Final Project two options: one aims to develop a network to recognise and count small moving objects overlapping during recording (like bees), the second one focuses in using a physics simulator for applying reinforcement learning to a robot or humanoid. In the latter case, Rakshit talked about the aicrowd competition (https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2019-learn-to-move-walk-around) which is currently open to participation. Even though I think this last option is hardly achievable given the timeline, I see the project extremely interesting. Such a project can encourage people to take part in competitions by using real-case files and goals, as well as it will help to set our knowledge. Additionally, a team (or teams) could emerge that will take part in the 2020 edition.

This group is for people starting out at Deep learning but don't wanna jump over to just to finish the coursework , the aim will be to understand the Maths behind every algorithm and go deep behind every concepts of deep learning as well as how differential privacy is helpful in maintaining privacy of data. Because Maths is most important and core to machine and deep learning. Also we will be preparing to start implementing research papers and then finally moving onto publishing our own research if we are able to do.
