Repo containing worked resources and personal notes of Secure and Private AI Facebook Scholarship Challenge - Udacity

Activities:

> **1. Trello Board**

Phase 1 of the scholarship was pouring out with exciting community events like meetups, quizzes, discussions etc. To make sure fellow
scholars don't miss out on these wonderful activities I had maintained a *Trello* board on a daily basis over the course of the challenge.
Thanks Bharati Subramanian for the contributions.

> **2. Weekly Kahoot Quiz on Secure and Private AI topics by Michael Sheinman**

Each weekend was a test of the knowledge we have gained from each of the lessons in the challenge course. The real-time nature of the quiz made it highly competitive and fun.
