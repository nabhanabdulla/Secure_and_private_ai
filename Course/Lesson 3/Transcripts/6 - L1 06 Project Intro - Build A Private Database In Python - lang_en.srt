1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
So now to get a first intuition for this.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,310
We're going to think about queries around the database.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,690
So in this first project,

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,810
what I'd like for you to do is to write a sort of function,

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,050
that makes it so that you can take this database and create

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,085
5000 other databases each with one person missing.

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:20,930
So as you can imagine the first database should have the first person missing,

8
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,515
the second database, you have a second person missing et cetera.

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:28,185
So you should end up with 5000 databases of length 4,999.

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:32,750
Jump right in, and I'll be right back in a moment to show you how I construct this.
