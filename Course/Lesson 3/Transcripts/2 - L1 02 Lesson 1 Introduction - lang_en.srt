Hello everyone. In this section,

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,790
we're going to be talking about differential privacy in the context of deep learning.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,864
In this context, differential privacy is about ensuring

4
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:12,060
that when our neural networks are learning from sensitive data,

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,565
that they're only learning what they're supposed to learn from the data

6
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,550
without accidentally learning what they're not supposed to learn from the data.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,810
Over this series of lessons and many projects which you'll be completing as we go,

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,139
we're going to walk through differential privacy from the early fundamentals

9
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:26,910
to one of the state-of-the-art methods for training

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,920
differentially private deep learning models.

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,015
The goal here is not just to give you an empirical ability to train a model using DP,

12
00:00:33,015 --> 00:00:36,140
but also for you to understand the foundational principles of

13
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,230
differential privacy such as how noise is applied or how we define privacy.

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,200
What you want to be able to do with this is to be able to

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,674
speak intelligently about the subject to engineers,

16
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:47,060
scientists, and stakeholders and you want to be able to

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,210
continue to consume differential privacy research as it's produced.

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,230
That'll be the goal of this course. So let's jump in.
